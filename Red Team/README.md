Imagine your house has a security guard (penetration test). They check the locks, windows, and alarm system to see if a robber can get in (find vulnerabilities).

Red team engagement is like having a friend pretend to be a robber. They try everything to break in (phishing emails, hacking, sneaking in) to see how well your guard (security team) responds to a real attack. 

#### Here's how they work:

* A team pretends to be real attackers (the "red team").
* They try to break into your systems using the same tricks real attackers use (phishing emails, hacking, sneaking in physically).
* Your regular security team (the "blue team") tries to stop them, just like they would a real attack.
* No one on the blue team knows the red team is coming, so it's a surprise attack, just like a real one.

#### Types of Red Team Engagement can be run in several ways:

* **Full Engagement:** Simulate an attacker's full workflow, from initial compromise until final goals have been achieved. Like the robber friend starting from outside and trying everything.
* **Assumed Breach:** Start by assuming the attacker has already gained control over some assets, and try to achieve the goals from there. As an example, the red team could receive access to some user's credentials or even a workstation in the internal network. Like the friend already being inside your house and trying to steal something. 
* **Table-top Exercise:** An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats. Ideal for situations where doing live simulations might be complicated. Talking through different attack scenarios to see how everyone would react.

_The goal is not for the red team to win, but to test the blue team's ability to respond to an attack._
