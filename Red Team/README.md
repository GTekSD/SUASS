# RED TEAMING GUIDE
![logo_3_3440x1440](https://github.com/GTekSD/SUASS/assets/55411358/e6eae309-989a-4424-b56f-a8350a85b6b8)

Imagine your house has a security guard (penetration test). They check the locks, windows, and alarm system to see if a robber can get in (find vulnerabilities).

Red team engagement is like having a friend pretend to be a robber. They try everything to break in (phishing emails, hacking, sneaking in) to see how well your guard (security team) responds to a real attack. 

_The goal is not for the red team to win, but to test the blue team's ability to respond to an attack._
--------

### Red Teaming Plan of Action

**Objective**:  
The primary goal of this red teaming engagement is to simulate real-world attack scenarios to test the client's security team's (blue team's) preparedness and incident response capabilities. By doing so, we identify weaknesses in both technology and personnel, helping the organization enhance its defenses against sophisticated attackers.

---

### 1. **Initial Planning & Scope Definition**

**1.1 Define Engagement Goals**  
The first step is to determine the objectives of the red teaming engagement. The goal is not for the red team to "win" but to gauge the organization's defense capabilities and improve them. Potential goals include:
- Test incident detection and response capabilities.
- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities in the organization's systems.
- Assess the security posture of both physical and digital environments.
- Evaluate employee security awareness and preparedness for social engineering attacks.

**1.2 Determine Engagement Type**  
The type of engagement should align with the client’s risk appetite and desired outcomes. Common engagement types include:
- **Full Engagement**: Simulating the entire attack lifecycle from initial compromise to the end goal.
- **Assumed Breach**: Begin with the assumption that the red team already has access to certain assets, testing internal security controls and lateral movement detection.
- **Tabletop Exercise**: An over-the-table discussion of attack scenarios, helping to identify potential weaknesses without actually executing live attacks.

**1.3 Scope and Constraints**  
- **Assets**: Clearly define which assets are in-scope for the attack (servers, networks, physical locations, employees).
- **Exclusions**: List any out-of-bounds areas (e.g., critical production systems that cannot tolerate disruptions).
- **Timing**: Decide when the engagement will take place and how long it will run.
- **Communication**: Define how and when the red team will communicate with the organization’s leadership and designated security officers.

---

### 2. **Engagement Preparation**

**2.1 Assemble the Red Team**  
The red team should consist of individuals with diverse skill sets in areas such as:
- Network penetration testing.
- Web application security.
- Social engineering.
- Physical security testing.

**2.2 Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)**  
Before the active phase of the engagement begins, the red team will conduct reconnaissance to collect information about the target. This might involve:
- **Open-source intelligence (OSINT)**: Collecting publicly available data on the organization and employees (LinkedIn profiles, social media posts, company website).
- **Network Scanning**: Identifying exposed services, subdomains, IP addresses, and other entry points.
- **Social Engineering Preparation**: Gathering information on employees to craft convincing phishing emails or phone calls.

**2.3 Setup Rules of Engagement (ROE)**  
Clear rules must be established to ensure safety and avoid unnecessary disruptions:
- **Allowed Tactics**: Define which tactics are permitted (e.g., phishing, physical entry, network attacks).
- **Emergency Procedures**: If an attack inadvertently causes damage or triggers significant concern, there must be a quick way to notify key stakeholders and pause the engagement.

---

### 3. **Execution of Red Team Engagement**

**3.1 Initial Compromise**  
- **Phishing**: Send spear-phishing emails to employees to capture credentials or deliver malware.
- **Social Engineering**: Call employees to extract sensitive information or gain physical access.
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Identify and exploit technical weaknesses in the network, applications, or infrastructure.
- **Physical Breaches**: Attempt unauthorized access to sensitive locations, such as data centers or offices.

**3.2 Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation**  
After gaining an initial foothold, the red team will try to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network to access more critical systems. Tactics may include:
- **Credential Dumping**: Extracting user credentials from compromised machines.
- **Pivoting**: Using compromised systems as stepping stones to access other parts of the network.

**3.3 Exfiltration and Goal Achievement**  
Simulate exfiltration of data or access to sensitive information, such as:
- Critical intellectual property.
- Customer data.
- Financial records.

The red team will document how far they were able to progress, what data they could access, and whether they could achieve the specified goals.

---

### 4. **Reporting & Post-Engagement Review**

**4.1 Immediate Debrief**  
After the engagement, the red team and key stakeholders (e.g., leadership, security officers) will meet to review:
- High-level findings.
- Blue team's detection and response times.
- Any major disruptions caused by the red team activities.

**4.2 Detailed Report Creation**  
A comprehensive report will be generated that includes:
- **Attack Path**: Step-by-step breakdown of how the red team achieved initial compromise, moved laterally, and escalated privileges.
- **Exploited Vulnerabilities**: A list of identified vulnerabilities, including technical, physical, and human-based weaknesses.
- **Blue Team's Response**: Assessment of the blue team’s detection and response times.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable remediation steps for each identified issue, categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

**4.3 Recommendations & Remediation Plan**  
- Provide detailed guidance on how to fix vulnerabilities discovered during the engagement.
- Suggest improvements to incident response protocols, detection tools, and employee security training.
  
**4.4 Post-Engagement Training & Lessons Learned**  
Conduct a session with the blue team to discuss:
- What went well during the engagement.
- Areas where improvements are needed.
- Techniques to improve detection and response.
- Update the organization's security policies and incident response plans based on the findings.

### 5. **Follow-Up and Retesting**

**5.1 Implement Recommendations**  
Work with the client to ensure that the recommended remediation steps are implemented. This may involve:
- Patching systems.
- Updating security protocols.
- Strengthening access controls.

**5.2 Retesting**  
Schedule a follow-up red teaming engagement to validate that the security improvements have been successfully implemented and the organization is better prepared for real-world attacks.

### 6. **Conclusion**

The red team engagement provides a realistic and comprehensive assessment of the client’s security posture, identifying not just technical vulnerabilities but also weaknesses in people and processes. By testing the organization in a controlled environment, we ensure that they are better prepared to defend against sophisticated attackers.

----------------
Red teaming involves simulating realistic attack scenarios to test the resilience of an organization’s security measures. As a red teamer, the goal is to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, applications, and human processes by using the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as real-world attackers.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Red Teaming

#### **1. Define Scope and Objectives**
- **Client Discussions**: Engage with the client to understand their security concerns, critical assets, and acceptable boundaries for testing. Ensure that the scope is well-defined to avoid unauthorized actions.
  - **Key Questions to Ask**:
    - What are the critical assets (data, systems, applications)?
    - What threats is the client most concerned about (e.g., data breaches, insider threats, ransomware)?
    - Are there any systems or areas out of scope for testing?
    - Does the client want a specific focus (e.g., network, cloud, social engineering)?

- **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**: Set clear rules for the engagement to define acceptable actions. For example:
  - Time frames for the engagement.
  - Systems that can be touched or must be avoided.
  - Testing approach (stealthy vs. noisy, black-box vs. white-box).
  - Contact points in case of incident escalation or need for clarification.

#### **2. Reconnaissance**
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) to map the client's external attack surface without directly interacting with their systems.
  - Tools: Search engines, social media, data leak sites, WHOIS lookups, subdomain enumeration, etc.
  - Goal: Identify exposed infrastructure, employee data, and other useful information.

- **Active Reconnaissance**: Interact with client assets to gather more detailed information.
  - Tools: Nmap, Shodan, Burp Suite, DNS enumeration.
  - Goal: Identify open ports, services, potential misconfigurations, and possible vulnerabilities.

#### **3. Initial Access**
- **Network-Based Exploits**: Look for vulnerabilities in externally exposed services and applications.
  - Techniques: Exploit unpatched software (e.g., CVE vulnerabilities), SQL injection, command injection, weak credentials.
  - Tools: Metasploit, Exploit-DB, custom scripts.

- **Social Engineering**: Simulate phishing attacks, baiting, or pretexting to gain access through users.
  - Techniques: Phishing emails, USB drops, voice calls, fake websites.
  - Tools: GoPhish, SET (Social Engineering Toolkit), custom lures.

#### **4. Privilege Escalation**
- Once access is gained, escalate privileges within the system.
  - **Local Privilege Escalation**: Exploit local vulnerabilities or misconfigurations (e.g., weak file permissions, outdated software).
  - **Lateral Movement**: Use compromised credentials or exploits to move through the network.
  - Tools: BloodHound, Mimikatz, Metasploit, PowerShell Empire.

#### **5. Persistence**
- Maintain access after initial exploitation to simulate how attackers would remain undetected.
  - **Persistence Techniques**: Scheduled tasks, registry modification, rootkits, implant backdoors.
  - Tools: Cobalt Strike, PowerShell scripts, custom persistence mechanisms.

#### **6. Command and Control (C2)**
- Set up a command and control infrastructure to simulate an attacker’s ability to control compromised systems.
  - C2 Tools: Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Covenant.
  - Techniques: Use HTTP(S), DNS, or other communication channels for stealthy command transmission.

#### **7. Data Exfiltration**
- Simulate data theft to measure the organization’s detection and response capabilities.
  - Target: Identify sensitive data (intellectual property, PII, financial records) and attempt to extract it.
  - Tools: Custom scripts for exfiltration, encrypted channels (FTP, HTTP/S, DNS tunneling).
  
#### **8. Post-Exploitation and Impact Assessment**
- Assess the potential damage that could have been inflicted on the organization.
  - Techniques: Encrypt files (ransomware simulation), tamper with data integrity, pivot to other systems.
  - Tools: Simulate DDoS attacks, tampering, or full system compromise.

#### **9. Reporting and Debriefing**
- **Documentation**: Compile detailed reports of your findings, highlighting vulnerabilities, exploited paths, and remediation recommendations.
  - Include: Screenshots, logs, and a clear timeline of activities.
  - Tailor the report for both technical and non-technical audiences.
  
- **Debriefing**: Hold a debrief session with the client to walk through the engagement and explain how the red team compromised systems and the risks involved.

#### **10. Recommendations and Follow-Up**
- Provide actionable remediation advice to address vulnerabilities.
  - Recommendations could range from patch management, network segmentation, and strengthening user training, to implementing more robust monitoring and detection.

- **Re-Test**: Offer to conduct a follow-up assessment once the client has implemented the remediation to validate their improved security posture.
