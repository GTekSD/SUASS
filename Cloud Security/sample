EXERCISE 4: IMPLEMENT KEY MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN AWS
Key management involves generating, using, protecting, storing, backing up, and deleting encryption keys.
LAB SCENARIO
Security professionals follow different data security methods to protect data stored on the cloud. Generally, data are encrypted to protect its 
confidentiality and integrity. Securing the encryption keys from unauthorized access is a major concern for security professionals. Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) provides a key management service for secured storing and rotating of encryption keys with 
strict access control. It is important for a security professional to understand AWS KMS and learn how to create and manage cryptographic keys 
and as well as implement the keys in AWS services and applications.
OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will learn to do the following:
• Create KMS Master Key
• Encrypt AWS S3 using AWS KMS Master Key
• Encrypt EBS Volume using AWS KMS Mater Key
• Encrypt Amazon Redshift Using KMS Master Key
OVERVIEW OF KEY MANAGEMENT
Cloud Key management is linked with Cloud Identity and Access Management and Cloud Audit Logs for controlling and monitoring access to 
individual keys and their use.

EXERCISE 5: SECURE AMAZON WEB SERVICES STORAGE
S3 buckets are used by customers and end-users to store text documents, PDFs, videos, images, etc.
LAB SCENARIO
In the cloud, data is stored on Internet-connected servers in data centres. It is important that security professionals understand and implement 
the data storage security features for data encryption and access management tools provided by service providers to secure the data stored in 
the data centres.
OBJECTIVE
This lab will demonstrate how to restrict access to S3 resources by creating bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and IAM policies to 
provide access to selected entities.
In this lab, you will learn to do the following:
• Assign Permissions to Amazon S3 Using ACL
• Assign Permissions to Amazon S3 Using Bucket Policy
OVERVIEW OF AWS STORAGE
Amazon S3 allows upload and retrieval data at any time and from anywhere on the Internet. It stores data as objects (text file/photo/video) 
within buckets. In the default state, all the Amazon S3 buckets are accessed by authorized users. Restrict access to S3 resources by combining 
bucket policies, ACLs and IAM polices to give access to the right entities.
