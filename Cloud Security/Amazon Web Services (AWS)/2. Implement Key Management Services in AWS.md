# EXERCISE 2: IMPLEMENT KEY MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN AWS
Key management involves generating, using, protecting, storing, backing up, and deleting encryption keys.
Security professionals follow different data security methods to protect data stored on the cloud. Generally, data are encrypted to protect its confidentiality and integrity. Securing the encryption keys from unauthorized access is a major concern for security professionals. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS) provides a key management service for secured storing and rotating of encryption keys with strict access control. It is important for a security professional to understand AWS KMS and learn how to create and manage cryptographic keys and as well as implement the keys in AWS services and applications.

### OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will learn to do the following:
- Create KMS Master Key
- Encrypt AWS S3 using AWS KMS Master Key
- Encrypt EBS Volume using AWS KMS Mater Key
- Encrypt Amazon Redshift Using KMS Master Key

### OVERVIEW OF KEY MANAGEMENT
Cloud Key management is linked with Cloud Identity and Access Management and Cloud Audit Logs for controlling and monitoring access to individual keys and their use.

Note: You need to execute Exercise 1 of this module before executing this lab as the user and group created in the previous lab are used in this lab.
Note: Ensure that Admin Machine-1 and PfSense Firewall virtual machines are running.

27. The gteksd-testing-group appears in Target bucket, scroll down and click on Save changes. 


28. Next, in the gteksd-testing-group bucket page, scroll down and click on Edit button under Default encryption. 


29. In the Edit default encryption window select Enable radio button and choose the AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS) radio button from the list of encryption key types, and select AWS managed key aws/s3 under AWS KMS key section, which will use the default AWS Managed Keys. Click on Save changes. 


30. We have created the gteksd-testing-group bucket for encrypting data. The user can push data into this bucket.


31. The user can also use a customer managed key for this bucket. Let us see how to use the customer managed key for the gteksd-testing-group bucket to encrypt the data.


32. Go to Key Management Services (KMS), and select Customer managed keys. 


33. Under the Customer managed keys pane, click on CCT_User_MasterKey Alias. 


34. Under the CCT_user_MasterKey’s General configuration, select the Amazon Resource Names (ARN) key which uniquely identify AWS resourceskey under the ARN field and copy it. 


35. Open Notepad and paste the copied link.


36. Switch to the browser. Navigate to S3 Management Console and select gteksd-testing-group under Bucket name. 


37. The gteksd-testing-group pane opens. Select the Properties tab. 


38. Scroll down and click on Edit button under Default encryption. 


39. Switch to Notepad and copy the key that we had pasted in Step 35.


40. Again, switch back to the Default Encryption and select the Enter AWS KMS key ARN radio button and paste the key that was copied in Step 35 in the AWS KMS key ARN. Click on Save changes. 


41. In this way, with the help of Customer Managed Keys, the user can encrypt and protectdata.


42. Amazon EBS supports KMS. Its encryption provides security to data at rest by encrypting data volumes, boot volumes, and snapshots using Amazon-managed keys or keys created and managed using the AWS KMS.


43. Click on Services from the menu bar, and search for EC2. From the search results, click on EC2 Virtual Servers in the Cloud as shown in the screenshot below. 


44. Once the EC2 Service Console page opens, click on Volumes in the left pane under Elastic Block Store. 


45. To create a new volume, click on Create Volume. 


46. In the Create Volume page, select the Volume Type and specify the size of the volume in the Size (GiB) field. If you need the disk to restore existing data, you can select a Snapshot ID, in which you have saved another volume’s Snapshot. Check Encryption: Encrypt this volume. 


47. In the Master Key field, select the Customer Managed Key we created: CCT_User_MasterKey. After entering the required details, scroll down and click on Create Volume. 


48. The Volume created successfully dialog message will appear once the disk is created. Click on Close. 


49. In this way, the KMS Master Key is used to encrypt the EBS volume.


50. As we have encrypted EBS Volume, we will now encrypt Amazon Redshift using KMS Master Key.


51. Go to main search bar and search for redshift and select Amazon Redshift. 


52. Close the welcome popup that appears. Click on Create cluster in the Redshift dashboard. 


53. The Cluster configuration page appears. (Here, we are selecting the Production option to create a new Redshift cluster. If you are in free trial, select a Free trial option, and proceed. Please note that if you select the Production option, your account will be charged as per the AWS pricing model so make sure that you delete the Redshift cluster service after performing the lab.) Scroll down the page to view the detailed configuration of the cluster. 


54. Type the password Dbuser123 in the Admin user password field. Keep the remaining default settings as it is and click on Create cluster.


55. The redshift-cluster-1 is now being created. Observe, that it is showed under the Status column as Modifying and Creating. Wait until the cluster is fully created. 


56. Once the cluster is fully created, you can see that the cluster’s Status is Available. 


57. Click on the newly created cluster link (here, the cluster link is redshift-cluster-1) to modify the cluster setting.


58. The newly created cluster redshift-cluster-1 page appears. Click on Edit button. 


59. The Edit cluster redshift-cluster-1 page appears, scroll down to Database configurations. Click on Open tab. 


60. You will be redirected to Properties section. In the Properties section click on Edit drop down and select Edit encryption. In Edit encryption window, choose the Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) radio button, then choose Use key from current account, and finally choose CCT_User_Masterkey in KMS key ID drop-down. Click Save changes. 


 See the cluster’s status in Status column. It shows Modifying and Resizing. 


62. On the AWS Web Console, click on Services and search for KMS. Select Key Management Service. 


63. Once the KMS Console page appears, click on Customer managed keys (here CCT_User_MasterKey). 


64. Scroll down until the Key users section. Click on Add. 


65. Use the search box to filter the IAM users. Type Alice as shown in the screenshot below and check Alice. We will add the IAM User Alice so that the user can access the Master Key. Click on Add. 


66. After you have added the user, it will appear as added in the Key users section. 


67. Thus, a security professional can implement AWS KMS.


68. Now ensure that you delete the created cluster. To do this, type redshift in the main search bar and select Amazon Redshift.


69. Select the Clusters icon from AWS icon bar on the left. Select the created cluster from the list and click Actions from the drop-down menu. Click Delete.Note: If the status of the cluster is still Modifying and Resizing wait for it to change to Available, then delete the Cluster. 


70. The Delete redshift-cluster-1 popup appears. Uncheck the Create Final Snapshot and click Delete cluster to delete the created cluster. 


71. Log out from the AWS platform and close all open windows.
