# EXERCISE 3: SECURE AMAZON WEB SERVICES STORAGE
S3 buckets are used by customers and end-users to store text documents, PDFs, videos, images, etc.
In the cloud, data is stored on Internet-connected servers in data centres. It is important that security professionals understand and implement the datasecurity features for data encryption and access management tools provided by service providers to secure the data stored in the data centres.

### OBJECTIVE
This lab will demonstrate how to restrict access to S3 resources by creating bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and IAM policies to provide access to selected entities.
In this lab, you will learn to do the following:
- Assign Permissions to Amazon S3 Using ACL
- Assign Permissions to Amazon S3 Using Bucket Policy

### OVERVIEW OF AWS 
Amazon S3 allows upload and retrieval data at any time and from anywhere on the Internet. It stores data as objects (text file/photo/video) within buckets. In the default state, all the Amazon S3 buckets are accessed by authorized users. Restrict access to S3 resources by combining bucket policies, ACLs and IAM polices to give access to the right entities.

Note: Before starting this lab, you should create an AWS account using the following: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup. Once the registration is completed, perform the following tasks.
Note: Ensure that Admin Machine-1 and PfSense Firewall virtual machines are running.

1. In the Admin Machine-1 virtual machine, double-click on the Google Chrome icon on the Desktop to open the browser.

2. The Google Chrome browser opens. Go to the address bar, type https://aws.amazon.com/, and press Enter.
Note: If you are already logged in, skip the login steps.
