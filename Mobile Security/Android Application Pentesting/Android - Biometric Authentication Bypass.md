# Biometric Authentication Bypass in Android

Biometric Authentication is a client-side security process that verifies a user’s identity based on unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, or voice recognition.

## Android [Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore) system

The Android Keystore is a system that allows developers to create and store cryptographic keys in a secure container, making them difficult to extract from the device, even using advanced techniques. These cryptographic keys are stored within specialized hardware known as TEE(Trusted Execution Environment). It is quite difficult to extract the keys stored in this TEE. Even the operating system does not have direct access to this secure memory. To perform the cryptographic operations and to receive the result within this secured environment, AndroidKeystore provides APIs to manage access.

## Biometric Authentication work flow

Fingerprint authentication can be implemented using either the [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager) or [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) and nested classes that manage the authentication mechanism, and an application dialogue asking the user to authenticate. Any of the aforementioned classes are used for application authentication, allowing the user to set the device’s biometric as a replacement for the username/password flow. After successful login using username and password, the user can choose to authenticate with the device’s biometric, thus the application creates an object that is placed in the Keystore and accessed when the fingerprint is valid. As a side note, FingerprintManager and FingerprintManagerCompact are deprecated since API 28 (Android 9).
