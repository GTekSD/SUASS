# Vulnerable Android Apps to Pentest

## AndroGoat
**Source:** https://github.com/satishpatnayak/AndroGoat

An open source vulnerable/insecure app using Kotlin. This app has a wide range of vulnerabilities related to certificate pinning, custom URL schemes, Android Network Security Configuration, WebViews, root detection and over 20 other vulnerabilities.

## Android License Validator
**Source:** https://mas.owasp.org/crackmes/Android#android-license-validator

The Android License Validator is a crackme that implements a key validation function in native code, packaged as a standalone ELF executable for Android devices. Analyzing native code is often more challenging than Java, which is why critical business logic is frequently written this way.

While this sample application may not represent a real-world scenario, it serves as a valuable learning tool to grasp the basics of symbolic execution. These insights can be applied in practical situations, especially when dealing with Android apps that include obfuscated native libraries. In fact, obfuscated code is often put into native libraries specifically to make the process of de-obfuscation more challenging.

A vulnerable app created in 2015, which can be used on older Android platforms.

## DIVA Android
**Source:** https://github.com/payatu/diva-android

An app intentionally designed to be insecure which has received updates in 2016 and contains 13 different challenges.

## DodoVulnerableBank
**Source:** https://github.com/CSPF-Founder/DodoVulnerableBank

An insecure Android app from 2015.

## DVHMA

A hybrid mobile app (for Android) that intentionally contains vulnerabilities.

## InsecureBankv2
**Source:** https://github.com/dineshshetty/Android-InsecureBankv2

A vulnerable Android app made for security enthusiasts and developers to learn the Android insecurities by testing a vulnerable application. It has been updated in 2018 and contains a lot of vulnerabilities.

## MASTG Hacking Playground (Java)
**Source:** https://github.com/OWASP/MASTG-Hacking-Playground/tree/master/Android/MASTG-Android-Java-App

A vulnerable Android app by the OWASP MAS project. See included vulnerabilities in [here](https://github.com/OWASP/MASTG-Hacking-Playground/wiki/Android-App).

## MASTG Hacking Playground (Kotlin)
**Source:** https://github.com/OWASP/MASTG-Hacking-Playground/tree/master/Android/MASTG-Android-Kotlin-App

A vulnerable Android app by the OWASP MAS project.

## OVAA
**Source:** https://github.com/oversecured/ovaa

An Android app that aggregates all the platform's known and popular security vulnerabilities.

## InsecureShop
**Source:** https://github.com/hax0rgb/InsecureShop/

InsecureShop is an intentionally designed Android application that showcases vulnerabilities, aiming to educate developers and security experts about common pitfalls within modern Android apps. It serves as a dynamic platform for refining Android pentesting skills.

The majority of these vulnerabilities can be exploited on non-rooted devices, posing risks from both remote users and malicious third-party applications. Notably, the app doesn't utilize any APIs. InsecureShop presents an opportunity to explore a range of vulnerabilities:

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Embedded login credentials within the code.
- **Insufficient URL Validation**: Allows loading of arbitrary URLs via Deeplinks.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Enables the execution of code from third-party packages.
- **Access to Protected Components**: Permits third-party apps to launch secure components.
- **Insecure Broadcast Receiver**: Registration of a broadcast enabling URL injection.
- **Insecure Content Provider**: Accessible content provider putting user data at risk.

Complementing these learning experiences, InsecureShop provides [documentation](https://docs.insecureshopapp.com/ "InsecureShop Docs") about the implemented vulnerabilities and their associated code. This documentation, however, refrains from offering complete solutions for each vulnerability showcased within the InsecureShop app.

## Android UnCrackable L4
**Source:** https://mas.owasp.org/crackmes/Android#android-uncrackable-l4

The Radare2 community always dreamed with its decentralized and free currency to allow r2 fans to make payments in places and transfer money between r2 users. A debug version of the r2Pay app has been developed and it will be supported very soon in many stores and websites. Can you verify that this is cryptographically unbreakable?

Hint: Run the APK in a non-tampered device to play a bit with the app.

1. There is a master PIN code that generates green tokens (aka r2coins) on the screen. If you see a red r2coin, then this token won't be validated by the community. You need to find out the 4 digits PIN code and the salt employed as well. Flag: `r2con{PIN_NUMERIC:SALT_LOWERCASE}`
2. There is a "r2pay master key" buried in layers of obfuscation and protections. Can you break the whitebox? Flag: `r2con{ascii(key)}`

**Versions:**

- `v0.9` - Release for OWASP MAS: Source code is available and the compilation has been softened in many ways to make the challenge easier and more enjoyable for newcomers.
- `v1.0` - Release for R2con CTF 2020: No source code is available and many extra protections are in place.
