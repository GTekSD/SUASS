# Root Detection Bypass using Frida in Android

Root detection is a common security measure implemented in many Android applications to prevent their execution on rooted devices. However, with tools like Frida, it's possible to bypass such detection mechanisms. This guide will walk you through the process of bypassing root detection using Frida in Android.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have good rooted device or emulator:

- Some of good Emulators:
  - [NoxPlayer](https://www.bignox.com/)
  - [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/product-desktop/download/)
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### Setup Frida:

Now, Install Frida by using following commands:

```bash
python -m pip install frida
python -m pip install objection
python -m pip install frida-tools
```

Alternatively, you can install them directly using pip:

```bash
pip install frida
pip install objection
pip install frida-tools
```
### Setup ADB - Android Debug Bridge

- [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
- [Universal ADB Drivers](https://adb.clockworkmod.com/) 

## Steps

### 1. Identify CPU Architecture

First, identify the CPU architecture of the target device by executing the following command:

```bash
adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
```

### 2. Download Frida Server

Download the appropriate Frida server binary from the [official Frida releases page](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/), based on the CPU architecture obtained in the previous step.

### 3. Check Package Name

Use `frida-ps` command to identify the package name of the target application:

```bash
frida-ps -Ua
```

### 4. Push Files to Device

Push the Frida server binary and the JavaScript file (rootbypass.js) to the device:

```bash
adb push frida-server-16.2.1-android-x86 /data/local/tmp
adb shell chmod 777 /data/local/tmp/frida-server-16.2.1-android-x86
adb push rootbypass.js /data/local/tmp
```

### 5. Start Frida Server

Start the Frida server on the device:

```bash
adb shell /data/local/tmp/frida-server-16.2.1-android-x86 &
```

### 6. Execute Frida Script

Execute the Frida script to bypass root detection for the target application:

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app -l rootbypass.js
```

Replace `com.example.app` with the actual package name of the target application.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to bypass root detection in Android applications using Frida. It's essential to understand that bypassing security measures like root detection may have legal implications and should only be performed on applications you have explicit permission to test or modify. Use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.
