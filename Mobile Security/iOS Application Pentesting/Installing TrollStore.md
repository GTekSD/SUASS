# Installing TrollStore

TrollStore is **not** a jailbreak. It is a utility which is able to permanently sign and install any application with almost any entitlement with the help of a CoreTrust bug. The latest releases of TrollStore (specifically 2.0 and later) work through the use of a CoreTrust bug in which code signatures are not correctly verified under certain circumstances.

Installing TrollStore is a process which varies depending on what device and iOS you are running, as a result, different guides are attached below depending on said combination

> If your device is on iOS 14.0 *beta 1* or earlier, is running iOS 16.7.x (excluding 16.7 RC (20H18)), or is running iOS 17.0.1 or newer, it will **never** be supported by TrollStore.
