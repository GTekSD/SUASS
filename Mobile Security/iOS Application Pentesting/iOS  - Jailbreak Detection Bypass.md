# Jailbreak Detection Bypass using Frida in iOS

Jailbreak detection is a common security measure implemented in many iOS applications to prevent their execution on Jailbroken devices. However, with tools like Frida, it's possible to bypass such detection mechanisms. This guide will walk you through the process of bypassing Jailbreak detection using Frida in iOS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started,

- Ensure you have Jailbreak supported iOS device:
  - Find Supported iOS Device. [Here]

- Python from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ncvdn91xzqp?hl=en-us&gl=US)

### Setup Frida:

1. Install Frida by using following commands:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install frida
    python -m pip install frida-tools
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install them directly using pip:
  
    ```bash
    pip install frida
    pip install frida-tools
    ```
2. Add frida into Environment Variables
    * Open the "Environment Variables" window
    * Select the Path variable under "System Variables" and click the "Edit" button
    * Click the "New" button
    * Insert path `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts` in the text field

3. Run below command to verify if Frida is installed properly
   ```
   frida -h
   ```
   Frida is properly installed if help is displayed.


### Download Frida Server

_Dvice must be jailbroken to install frida._

#### Cydia
1. Start `Cydia`
2. Go to `Manage` -> `Sources` -> `Edit`
3. Add and enter `https://build.frida.re`.
4. You should now be able to find and install the Frida package which lets Frida inject JavaScript into apps running on your iOS device.
5. This happens over USB, so you will need to have your USB cable handy, though there’s no need to plug it in just yet.

#### Sileo
1. Start `Sileo`
2. Copy URL: https://build.frida.re
3. Go to `Sources` -> Tap on `➕` icon -> `Add 1 Source`.
4. or `Enter Manually` : `https://build.frida.re` -> `Add Source`.
5. You should now be able to find and install the Frida package which lets Frida inject JavaScript into apps running on your iOS device.
6. This happens over USB, so you will need to have your USB cable handy, though there’s no need to plug it in just yet.

### Start Frida Server

1. In `Cydia` or `Sileo`
2. Go to `Sources` -> `Frida` Under Repositories -> `Frida`
3. Click on `GET` -> `QUEUE` -> `Confirm`

_It automaticly Start the Frida server as soon as you download._

### Check Package Name

Now, open a new terminal.

Use `frida-ps` command to identify the package name of the target application:

```bash
frida-ps -Uai
```
_It shows Application Identity over USB_

If it dosen't show, then open the target application and then run command again.

### Execute Frida Script

Execute the Frida script to bypass jailbreak detection for the target application, but first, you need to download a javascript file, Download form [This Dork](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Acodeshare.frida.re+Jailbreak+Detection+Bypass) or you can run online. require internet connection.

Now open the targeted app that you wanted to bypass jailbreak detection, then run the following command:

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app --codeshare liangxiaoyi1024/ios-jailbreak-detection-bypass
```
If you have downloaded script:
```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app -l Downloaded_script.js
```

Replace `com.example.app` with the actual package name of the target application that you got `frida-ps -Uai`

### BOOM! BYPASSED!

With these steps, you should be able to bypass jailbreak detection in iOS applications using Frida. It's essential to understand that bypassing security measures like jailbreak detection may have legal implications and should only be performed on applications you have explicit permission to test or modify. Use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.

# Bypassing and avoiding jailbreak detection.

> DANGER: 
> We do not recommend using banking apps on a jailbroken device. Use a separate secure device to access your bank account.

Many apps, which rely on security, will have algorithms to detect and block jailbroken users from using the app. This includes banking apps, some online videogames (e.g. Pokemon Go, Mario Kart Tour) and other privacy focused apps such as Snapchat.

This is great from a security standpoint, as a jailbroken device is much more likely to become compromised compared to stock iOS. This can cause an issue, however, when some of us just want to use the apps we need to use.

> DANGER: 
> Blocking jailbreak detection can stop you from accessing photos and other files while in selected applications.

Now, we'll go through each tweak that can be used to minimize jailbreak detection. Some apps, however, cannot be patched and will not work when jailbroken, regardless of the content below. Other apps may need bypasses made specifically for them.

> TIP: 
> Choicy is available on the default BigBoss repo, however we recommend adding the developer's repo to ensure you have the most up-to-date version.

There is other software available for hiding jailbreak, such as [Shadow](sileo://package/me.jjolano.shadow) (<a href="sileo://source/https://ios.jjolano.me/">ios.jjolano.me</a>), however we'll only be covering the above tweaks in this guide.

## Installation

1. Open your package manager app (e.g. Cydia, Sileo, Zebra)
1. Add the three repos linked above
1. Search for and install the three packages
1. Respring when prompted

## A-Bypass

> TIP: 
> According to the tweak's author, A-Bypass works better on libhooker-based jailbreaks, such as <router-link to="/installing-chimera">Chimera</router-link>, <router-link to="installing-odyssey">Odyssey</router-link>, <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">odysseyra1n</router-link>, and <router-link to="/installing-taurine">Taurine</router-link>. It still works on Substrate/Substitute-based jailbreaks, such as checkra1n and unc0ver, however.

1. Open the Settings application
2. Scroll down to `A-Bypass`
3. Tap on `Check for Updates`
	- If a new app doesn't work with A-Bypass, you should always try to go back and try to check for updates in the A-Bypass preferences again.
4. Scroll down and enable any apps you wish to block jailbreak detection with.

## Liberty Lite

1. Open the Settings application
1. Scroll down to `Liberty Lite`
1. Enable `Enable Liberty`
1. Tap on `Block Jailbreak Detection`
1. Enable all the apps you want to block jailbreak detection with

## Choicy

> TIP: 
> This is the best option for users wanting to use Snapchat on their jailbroken device.

> TIP: 
> If you use a libhooker-based jailbreak, such as <router-link to="/installing-chimera">Chimera</router-link>, <router-link to="installing-odyssey">Odyssey</router-link>, <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">odysseyra1n</router-link>, or <router-link to="/installing-taurine">Taurine</router-link>, then [libhooker configurator](#libhooker-configurator) serves the same purpose as Choicy, while being natively integrated into libhooker.

1. Open the Settings application
1. Scroll down to `Choicy`
1. Tap on `Applications`
1. Tap on an application that you selected with Liberty Lite
1. Enable `Custom Tweak Configuration`
	- For Snapchat, enable `Disable Tweak Injection` and skip the next steps
1. Make sure `Whitelist` is selected
1. Enable the bypass you're using - for Liberty Lite this would be `zzzzzLiberty`, or `!ABypass2` for A-Bypass.
1. Repeat this for every app you've selected to use with your bypass tweak.

## libhooker configurator

> WARNING: 
> This only works on libhooker-based jailbreaks! If you use a Substrate or Substitute based jailbreak, such as checkra1n or unc0ver, then this *will not work*, and you should use [Choicy](#choicy) instead!

1. Open the `libhooker` application
1. Tap "Applications"
1. Scroll down to the application you wish to configure, and tap on it
1. Here, you can either disable tweaks entirely in this application, or configure individual tweaks.
   - To configure individual tweaks, enable "Override Configuration", which will open up options to only allow specific tweaks or deny specific tweaks.
   - For example, to allow only Liberty Lite, you'd select `Allow`, then select `zzzzzLiberty`.
   - If you're using A-Bypass, you'd enable `!ABypass2` instead.

## KernBypass (iOS 12.0 - 14.2)

> TIP: 
> This is the best option for users wanting to use Nintendo apps (Mario Kart Tour, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, etc) and Pokemon GO on their jailbroken device.

> WARNING: 
> KernBypass will not work on iOS 14 using unc0ver. Look into [vnodebypass](#vnodebypass) instead.

> DANGER: 
> KernBypass is a kernel tweak. Do not install on unsupported devices, use it at your own risk.

1. Open the Settings application
1. Scroll down to `KernBypass`
1. Tap `Enable KernBypass`
1. Enable all the apps you want to block jailbreak detection with

## vnodebypass

> TIP: 
> vnodebypass is similar to KernBypass in regards to what it can bypass, but be aware that while it is active, you will lose access to your tweaks!

> DANGER: 
> vnodebypass is a kernel tweak. Do not install on unsupported devices, use it at your own risk.

1. If you are on iOS 14, ensure that `libkrw` 1.1.0 or later is installed. It is available in the default Elucubratus repository, if you are using unc0ver or checkra1n.
2. Open the `vnodebypass` app
3. Tap the `Enable` button
4. When done using the app with jailbreak detection, go back into the `vnodebypass` app and tap `Disable`
_N0te: You can remember this command as "Frida yo**u** **f**uck example.app and use **l**ub script.js"_
