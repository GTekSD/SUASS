## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process that allows you to truly unlock the potential of your iOS device. Apple's mobile operating system is known for its security and that's partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.

Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and "tweaks" (modifications) from a package manager (Cydia or Sileo) to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices.

The purpose of jailbreaking is to disable iOS protections (Apple's code signing mechanisms in particular) so that arbitrary unsigned code can run on the device, enables penetration testers to access and read any file on the device, including the files of other apps, cookies, and keychain. This access allows for a more comprehensive examination of the security posture of the target application.

#### What can I do once jailbroken?

- Gain full access to your device's OS
- Get access to a package manager, such as Sileo or Zebra
- Install themes to change the look and feel of your device
- Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves

### What are the different types?

There are 4 main types of jailbreaks:

1. Untethered
2. Semi-Untethered
3. Semi-Tethered
4. Tethered

Each type is determined by how independent it is from a computer.

#### 1. Untethered Jailbreaks

Untethered jailbreaks can be considered the holy grail of all jailbreaks. They only require the exploit to be ran once either via a website, an app or a computer.

![A screenshot of the p0sixspwn jailbreak](/assets/images/p0sixpwn.png)

After that, your device is fully jailbroken and won't require any further action. The exploit will stay on a device even after you reboot it.

Unfortunately, there hasn't been a new untethered jailbreak for end users in a very long time, and it's likely we won't see one for even longer.

The only downside to an untethered jailbreak is that if something goes wrong, it could very well result in a bootloop requiring you to restore your device via iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina or newer). The likelihood of this happening is _low_, but is indeed possible.

A few examples of untethered jailbreaks are <router-link to="/installing-p0sixspwn">p0sixspwn</router-link> and Pangu9.

#### 2. Semi-Untethered Jailbreaks

Semi-untethered jailbreaks have been the most popular type of jailbreak in recent years. This type of jailbreak requires an exploit to be executed every time you reboot or turn off your device.

<img src="/assets/images/odysseymain.png" width="180" alt="A screenshot of the Odyssey jailbreak" class="align-right"/>

This jailbreak works by running the exploit through an app or website on the device itself. Due to the nature of how the exploit is ran, however, these jailbreaks are easily removable through their respective app.

A few examples of semi-untethered jailbreaks include <router-link to="/installing-taurine">Taurine</router-link>, <router-link to="/installing-dopamine">Dopamine</router-link>, and <router-link to="/installing-odyssey">Odyssey</router-link>.

#### 3. Semi-Tethered Jailbreaks

Semi-tethered jailbreaks are very similar to semi-untethered jailbreaks, however the exploit must be ran using a computer rather than using a sideloaded app.

![A screenshot of the checkra1n jailbreak](/assets/images/checkra1n.png)

Due to requiring a computer to rejailbreak after every reboot, most choose to use a semi-untethered jailbreak instead.

A few examples of a semi-tethered jailbreak include <router-link to="/installing-palera1n">palera1n</router-link> and <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">Odysseyra1n</router-link>.

#### 4. Tethered Jailbreaks

Tethered jailbreaks are not meant to be used by the general public. These exploits modify the device in a way that it requires a PC to even boot at all, even without a jailbreak.

Because of this, these tend to only be used by jailbreak developers getting ready for a newer version of iOS.

## What is a package manager?

Package managers are APT frontends, or more simply, an App Store for tweaks. They allow you to browse repositories (sometimes referred to as repos or sources) and download tweaks, apps, and other pieces of software for your jailbroken device. Different jailbreaks come bundled with different package managers by default, but the most popular is Cydia.

### Sileo

[Sileo](https://getsileo.app/) is a Package Manager maintained by [Amy](https://twitter.com/elihwyma) for iOS 11 and above. Sileo prides itself on its Swift-based design, fast performance, and general QOL improvements, such as proper iPad support.

Sileo is installed by default on Electra, Chimera, Odyssey, Taurine, and Odysseyra1n. Sileo is also downloadable through checkra1n as well as unc0ver on iOS 12.0 and higher.

### Cydia

Cydia is a package manager that has long been considered the face of jailbreaking, being the package manager of choice for most jailbreaks. [Saurik](https://twitter.com/saurik), the original creator of Cydia, has stopped maintaining the project, but in recent years [Sam Bingner](https://twitter.com/sbingner) has updated the software for modern devices and iOS versions.

Cydia is included by default in unc0ver, checkra1n and other older jailbreaks.

### Installer 5

Installer, developed by Nullriver Software was among the very first package managers available for iOS, being the package manager of choice during the earlier years of iOS jailbreaking. After the release of iPhone OS 2, the software was broken and Cydia overtook it as the most used package manager.

After many revival attempts over the years, Installer 5 was finally released to the public in 2019 by the AppTapp Team. It features an updated modern design with dozens of customization options available to choose from.

### Zebra

Zebra is a more recent package manager, providing support for iOS 9 and above. It is open source, and features a much more familar user interface for Cydia users compared to other package managers.

## What are tweaks?

Tweaks are small modifications that can be installed change the look and/or feel of your device.

Unlike apps, tweaks usually don't come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Some simpler tweaks might not even have this.

## What is "respringing" or "Restarting Springboard"?

Respringing is essentially restarting the home screen and the iOS UI. Most of the time, you can install a tweak and espring to apply it, without fully rebooting.

You won't have to reinstall an exploit after respringing, however, and you can remain jailbroken.

## What is Recovery Mode?

Recovery Mode is a protection built-in to your device that allows the user to completely start over with a fresh install of iOS. This is especially useful if the installed OS is damaged and cannot start properly, which can happen during jailbreaks, although rare. Entering recovery mode can be done on device and through a computer, and iTunes/Finder utilise recovery mode during normal upgrades and restores.

## What is DFU mode?

DFU mode is a way you can interact with your iOS device without loading the operating system or boot loader. It stands for Device Firmware Upgrade. It's functionally different from recovery mode and is generally intended as a last resort in case things seriously go wrong on your device, however we can use it with <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">Odysseyra1n</router-link> to jailbreak your device instead. Entering DFU mode can only be done on device as it is part of the phone itself.

## What is the latest iOS version with a jailbreak

- **A7 iPads**: iOS 12.5.7 (via Odysseyra1n or Chimera)
- **A7/A8 iPhones**: iOS 12.5.7 (via Odysseyra1n or Chimera)
- **iPod Touch (6th Generation)**: iOS 12.5.7 (via Odysseyra1n or Chimera)
- **A8(X) iPads**: iPadOS 15.8.2 (via meowbrek2 or palera1n)
- **iPod Touch (7th Generation)**: iOS 15.8.2 (via Dopamine, meowbrek2, or palera1n)
- **A9/A10 iPhones**: iOS 15.8.2 (via Dopamine, meowbrek2, or palera1n)
- **A9(X) iPads**: iPadOS 16.7.6 (via palera1n)
- **A10(X) iPads**: iPadOS 17.3.1 (via palera1n)
- **A11 iPhones**: iOS 16.7.6 (via palera1n)
- **A12-A14 iPhones**: iOS 16.5.1 (via Dopamine)
- **A12-A14/M1 iPads**: iPadOS 16.5.1 (via Dopamine)
- **A15/A16 iPhones**: iOS 16.5 (via Dopamine)
- **A15/M2 iPads**: iPadOS 16.5 (via Dopamine)

Note that A12 and newer devices running iOS 16.6 or newer do not have a jailbreak, which also inherently means no A17 device has a jailbreak currently.

## Installing TrollStore

TrollStore is **not** a jailbreak. It is a utility which is able to permanently sign and install any application with almost any entitlement with the help of a CoreTrust bug. The latest releases of TrollStore (specifically 2.0 and later) work through the use of a CoreTrust bug in which code signatures are not correctly verified under certain circumstances.

Installing TrollStore is a process which varies depending on what device and iOS you are running, as a result, different guides are attached below depending on said combination

> If your device is on iOS 14.0 *beta 1* or earlier, is running iOS 16.7.x (excluding 16.7 RC (20H18)), or is running iOS 17.0.1 or newer, it will **never** be supported by TrollStore.
