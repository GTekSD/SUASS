# [Dopamine](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine) - Rootless arm64e jailbreak for iOS 15.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e) and iOS 15.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64). <img src="https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine/assets/52459150/ed04dd3e-d879-456d-9aa3-d4ed44819c7e" width="30" />

Dopamine is a semi-untethered jailbreak, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

Dopamine supports A9(X) and later devices on iOS 15.0 to 16.5, A9(X) to A14 and M1 devices on iOS 16.5.1, and A9(X) to A11 devices on iOS 16.6 to 16.6.1.

If you're using an A8(X) iPad, at this time, you should follow Installing meowbrek2 instead.

if you are currently using *rootful* palera1n, you need to first Remove rootful palera1n before proceeding.

## Installing Dopamine

### Downloads

- The latest version of [Dopamine](https://ellekit.space/dopamine)
    - Make sure to download the `.ipa` file onto your iOS device

### Installing Dopamine

1. Open [`TrollStore`](./Installing%20TrollStore.md)
1. Press the `+` on the top right
1. Go to where you saved the Dopamine `.ipa` file
1. Tap on the Dopamine `.ipa` file
1. Tap `Install`

The Dopamine app will now be installed onto your device.

### Running Dopamine

1. Reboot your phone
    - This is not necessary but recommended
1. Open the Dopamine application from your home screen immediately afterwards
1. Tap "Jailbreak"


If the app or your device crashes/restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try rebooting and running the exploit again until it does work.

Sileo should now be installed on your home screen. You can use Sileo to install tweaks, themes and more.

While you are now jailbroken at this point, we need to both update and install some packages so that we're able to both update other packages and have stuff work properly

## Installing necessary software

1. Open the Sileo app
1. Tap on the "Sources" tab
1. Tap on the "ElleKit" repository, then tap on "All Categories"
1. Tap on `ElleKit`
1. Tap "Get"
1. Tap the "Queued" bar at the bottom of the page
1. Tap "Confirm"
1. Once finished, tap `Restart SpringBoard Later`
1. Go to the "Search" tab
1. Search for `PreferenceLoader`
1. Tap on `PreferenceLoader`
1. Tap on "Get"
1. Tap the "Queued" bar at the bottom of the page
1. Tap "Confirm"
1. Once finished, tap `Restart SpringBoard`

After doing all the above steps, you may need to reboot and rejailbreak in order for tweak injection to function properly.


# [palera1n](https://palera.in/) - Jailbreak for A8 through A11 devices, on iOS 15.0 and higher.

palera1n is a work-in-progress jailbreak that is compatible with A11 (iPhone X) and earlier devices on iOS 15.0 or later, with some caveats for A11 devices.

On A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if your device is an A11 device on iOS 16 and you've set a passcode before, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

> If you are using Windows, you should follow [palen1x](#using-palen1x) guide instead.
> If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode
> If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

## Installing the jailbreak | macOS

### Installing palera1n

1. Open a terminal window
1. Run `sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://static.palera.in/scripts/install.sh)"`

### Running palera1n

> If you're using an Apple Silicon Mac and using a USB-C port to plug your cable/adapter into, you'll need to unplug and replug the device after `Checkmate!` appears in the logs.

1. Run `palera1n`
    - Make sure your device is plugged in when entering this command
1. When ready, press `Enter` and follow the on screen instructions to enter <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>.

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

1. In the terminal window, press `Control` + `C` on your keyboard
1. Rerun the command that you just ran

You'll need to do this every time you rejailbreak your device as well.


## Installing the jailbreak | Linux

> If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc) you will not succeed with following this guide.
> If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

### Installing palera1n

1. Open up a terminal window
1. Run `sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd`
1. Run `sudo usbmuxd -f -p`
1. Open up another terminal window
1. Run `sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://static.palera.in/scripts/install.sh)"`

### Running palera1n

1. Run `sudo palera1n`
    - Make sure your device is plugged in when entering this command
1. When ready, press `Enter` and follow the on screen instructions to enter <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>.

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

1. In the terminal window, press `Control` + `C` on your keyboard
1. Rerun the command that you just ran

You'll need to do this every time you rejailbreak your device as well.

Once the device boots up, open the palera1n loader app and tap `Sileo`. After a bit of time, you'll be prompted to set a passcode for using command line stuff, and then afterwards,`Sileo` should be on your home screen.

To rejailbreak your device, simply rerun the command you just ran and then repeat any other applicable steps.

## Installing the jailbreak | Windows

If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc) you will not succeed with following this guide, and will need to obtain a bootable medium and follow the below steps using that bootable medium.

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

palen1x is a live bootable Linux environment that allows you to quickly run palera1n on a compatible device. palera1n is capable of jailbreaking iOS devices with A8(X) to A11 SoC's on iOS 15.0 or later

On A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if your device is an A11 device on iOS 16 and you've set a passcode before, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

### Requirements

- A 128MB or greater USB Drive
    - If you don't have a USB Drive, but do have another form of supported removable bootable hardware (e.g. A CD or DVD), you can use that instead of a USB Drive
- The latest version of [palen1x](https://github.com/palera1n/palen1x/releases)
- [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases)

### Installing Ventoy

1. Download and extract the contents of the `Ventoy.zip` file
1. Insert your USB drive if you have not already done so, and open the `Ventoy2Disk.exe` file
1. Select the USB drive you would like to boot palen1x from
    - This USB drive will be completely erased
    - Ensure you back up all important data beforehand
1. Click `Install` and confirm that you are ok erasing the USB drive
    - Do not remove your USB Drive until the process has completed
1. Once it has installed, copy the palen1x iso file that you downloaded onto the USB drive

### Booting palen1x

1. Reboot, and then go into your BIOS settings and disable Secure Boot, then enter the boot picker and select your USB Drive to boot from
    - This is different for every computer
    - Search your PC or motherboard brand to find out how to get to your BIOS settings if you are unsure
1. Press enter once you see the Ventoy screen to boot into palen1x

### Running palera1n

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

1. Once you have loaded palen1x, select `Shell`
1. Type `palera1n`
1. Follow the on screen instructions to enter <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>.

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

1. In the terminal window, press `Control` + `C` on your keyboard
1. Rerun the command that you just ran

You'll need to do this every time you rejailbreak your device as well.

Once the device boots up, open the palera1n loader app and tap `Sileo`. After a bit of time, you'll be prompted to set a passcode for using command line stuff, and then afterwards,`Sileo` should be on your home screen.

To rejailbreak your device, simply rerun the command you just ran and then repeat any other applicable steps.
