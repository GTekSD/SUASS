# Jailbreak Detection Bypass using Frida in Android

Jailbreak detection is a common security measure implemented in many iOS applications to prevent their execution on Jailbroken devices. However, with tools like Frida, it's possible to bypass such detection mechanisms. This guide will walk you through the process of bypassing Jailbreak detection using Frida in iOS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started,

- Ensure you have Jailbreak supported iOS device:
  - Find Supported iOS Device. [Here]

- Python from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ncvdn91xzqp?hl=en-us&gl=US)

### Setup Frida:

1. Install Frida by using following commands:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install frida
    python -m pip install frida-tools
    python -m pip install objection        (Optional)
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install them directly using pip:
  
    ```bash
    pip install frida
    pip install frida-tools
    pip install objection                  (Optional)
    ```
2. Add frida into Environment Variables
    * Open the "Environment Variables" window
    * Select the Path variable under "System Variables" and click the "Edit" button
    * Click the "New" button
    * Insert path `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts` in the text field

3. Run below command to verify if Frida is installed properly
   ```
   frida -h
   ```
   Frida is properly installed if help is displayed.


### Download Frida Server

_Dvice must be jailbroken to install frida._

#### Cydia
1. Start `Cydia`
2. Go to `Manage` -> `Sources` -> `Edit`
3. Add and enter `https://build.frida.re`.
4. You should now be able to find and install the Frida package which lets Frida inject JavaScript into apps running on your iOS device.
5. This happens over USB, so you will need to have your USB cable handy, though there’s no need to plug it in just yet.

#### Sileo
1. Start `Sileo`
2. Copy URL: https://build.frida.re
3. Go to `Sources` -> Tap on `➕` icon -> `Add 1 Source`.
4. or `Enter Manually` : `https://build.frida.re` -> `Add Source`.
5. You should now be able to find and install the Frida package which lets Frida inject JavaScript into apps running on your iOS device.
6. This happens over USB, so you will need to have your USB cable handy, though there’s no need to plug it in just yet.

### Start Frida Server

1. In `Cydia` or `Sileo`
2. Go to `Sources` -> `Frida` Under Repositories -> `Frida`
3. Click on `GET` -> `QUEUE` -> `Confirm`

_It automaticly Start the Frida server as soon as you download._

### Check Package Name

Now, open a new terminal.

Use `frida-ps` command to identify the package name of the target application:

```bash
frida-ps -Uai
```
_It shows Application Identity over USB_

If it dosen't show, then open the target application and then run command again.

### Execute Frida Script

Execute the Frida script to bypass jailbreak detection for the target application, but first, you need to download a javascript file, Download form [This Dork](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Acodeshare.frida.re+Jailbreak+Detection+Bypass) or you can run online. require internet connection.

Now open the targeted app that you wanted to bypass jailbreak detection, then run the following command:

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app --codeshare liangxiaoyi1024/ios-jailbreak-detection-bypass
```
If you have downloaded script:
```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app -l Downloaded_script.js
```

Replace `com.example.app` with the actual package name of the target application that you got `frida-ps -Uai`

_N0te: You can remember this command as "Frida yo**u** **f**uck example.app and use **l**ub script.js"_

### BOOM! BYPASSED!

With these steps, you should be able to bypass jailbreak detection in iOS applications using Frida. It's essential to understand that bypassing security measures like jailbreak detection may have legal implications and should only be performed on applications you have explicit permission to test or modify. Use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.
