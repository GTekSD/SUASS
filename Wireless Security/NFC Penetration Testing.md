# NFC Penetration Testing

NFC (Near Field Communication) technology in the mobile devices allow users to access various services within a single device. This technology has several vulnerabilities which may lead to various attacks, such as eavesdropping, data modification, data corruption, etc. You need to test NFC devices to reveal unknown vulnerabilities that may be exploited to gather confidential information, such as credit card numbers, login credentials, etc.

## Introduction to NFC Penetration Testing

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range, wireless connection standard that uses radio waves to establish communication between electronic devices. It establishes communication either by touching together the devices or by locating them in close proximity. The NFC standard is designed on the basis of RFID standard. It also includes different data exchange formats as well as communication protocols. This standard does not guarantee secure communication even though the communication range is limited to a few centimeters (maximum 20 cm). The reason is that, it does not require any form of passwords or login credentials to get connected. This provides opportunity to the malicious outsiders to gain access to devices, user credentials, and other confidential information.  

NFC is an emerging technology which many organizations use for short range communication. For you, it is important to test the NFC communications of the target organization and reveal the possible threats organizations may face. NFC technology is susceptible to various attacks, such as eavesdropping, data corruption, data modification, spoofing, MITM attack, etc. Hence, NFC penetration testing is required to identify vulnerabilities and also to resolve them beforehand for making a system immune to security attacks.

## Perform Eavesdropping

NFC technology broadcasts radio signals in the vicinity of the transmitter and not just to the intended receiver, there is a scope to grab signals as the communication takes place between the devices in close proximity. NFC eavesdropping is a consequence in which an antenna is used to record the communication between NFC and other devices or we may simply say that one may record communications between NFC devices by means of large and sophisticated antenna.  

The main objective of this attack is to intercept the NFC exchange process to corrupt the information being exchanged and make it useless. You need to test whether the target NFC devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping or not. To perform eavesdropping you need to use an antenna to capture the communication between the NFC devices. Organizations need to secure the NFC communication channel so that the information is encrypted and only an authorized device may decrypt it. Secondly, they need to set the range of NFC so that limited devices may be connected.
