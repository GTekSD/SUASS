# Wireless Penetration Testing

## Objective 

Wireless networks are inexpensive and easy to maintain when compared to wired networks. A malicious outsider may easily compromise a wireless network, if proper security measures are not applied or if there is no appropriate network configuration. You need to perform wireless network penetration testing to determine critical sources, risks, or vulnerabilities associated with it and then check whether the current security mechanism is able to protect the wireless network against all possible attacks. If not, upgrade the security mechanisms. 

This module describes various steps involved in wireless network penetration testing. It explains in depth about testing various components of wireless networks, such as wireless LAB, RFID devices, and NFC technology in devices.

## Wireless Penetration Testing
Wireless network provides extension to the organization's infrastructure perimeter. Typical wireless infrastructure may include use of the following wireless technology/devices:  

- **Wireless local area network (WLAN) (802.11)**: Wireless Network (Wi-Fi) refers to wireless local area networks (WLAN) based on IEEE 802.11 standard where it allows the device to access the network from anywhere within range of an access point (AP).
- **Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)**: RFID is a technology that uses radio signals to identify and record the presence of objects.
- **Near Field Communication (NFC)**: NFC is a type of short-range wireless communication between devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc.
- **Mobile Devices**: They are portable handheld devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc. 
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: IoT is referred as the network of computing devices that are web-enabled and have the capability of sensing, collecting, and sending data using sensors, communication hardware, and processors that are embedded within the device.

Wireless penetration testing is the process of actively evaluating information security measures in a wireless network. This process combines different attack techniques and methods to identify vulnerabilities in the perimeter of the target organizationâ€™s wireless network. It involves an active analysis of the information security measures for design weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and technical flaws and the results are documented in a report. Wireless penetration testing should be conducted separately and thoroughly. The report containing the results of security issues is delivered to executive, technical audiences, and management.  
The wireless penetration testing involves the following factors: 

- Security control auditing: To test and validate the efficiency of wireless security protections and controls.
- Data theft detection: Find streams of sensitive data by sniffing the traffic. 
- Information system management: Collect information on security protocols, network strength and connected devices, typically using network discovery, service identification modules, port scanner, and OS.
- Risk prevention and response: Provide comprehensive approach of preparation steps that may be taken to prevent upcoming exploitation.
- Upgrading infrastructure: Change or upgrade existing infrastructure of software, hardware, or network design.
- Threat assessment: Identify the wireless threats on information assets of an organization.
