# Wireless Penetration Testing

## Objective 

## Wireless Penetration Testing
Wireless network provides extension to the organization's infrastructure perimeter. Typical wireless infrastructure may include use of the following wireless technology/devices:  

- Wireless local area network (WLAN) (802.11): Wireless Network (Wi-Fi) refers to wireless local area networks (WLAN) based on IEEE 802.11 standard where it allows the device to access the network from anywhere within range of an access point (AP).
- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): RFID is a technology that uses radio signals to identify and record the presence of objects.
- Near Field Communication (NFC): NFC is a type of short-range wireless communication between devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc.
- Mobile Devices: They are portable handheld devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc. 
- Internet of Things (IoT): IoT is referred as the network of computing devices that are web-enabled and have the capability of sensing, collecting, and sending data using sensors, communication hardware, and processors that are embedded within the device.

Wireless penetration testing is the process of actively evaluating information security measures in a wireless network. This process combines different attack techniques and methods to identify vulnerabilities in the perimeter of the target organizationâ€™s wireless network. It involves an active analysis of the information security measures for design weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and technical flaws and the results are documented in a report. Wireless penetration testing should be conducted separately and thoroughly. The report containing the results of security
