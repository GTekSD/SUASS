## Getting Started in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a critical field in today's digital world, and this repository aims to provide a centralized location for a wealth of knowledge and study materials. Whether you're just starting your journey in cybersecurity or you're an experienced professional, you'll find valuable resources here.

üõ°Ô∏è Start your journey into cybersecurity by reading the [CyBOK (Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge)](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/CyBOK_v1.1.0.pdf). | [MIRROR](./CyBOK_v1.1.0.pdf)

#### üî± Additionally, consider learning the following topics:
1. Computer Basics  
2. Networking Basics
3. Windows and Linux 
4. Programming Languages (e.g., Python, C, php, Javascript)
5. CTFs (Capture the Flags) - [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/)

‚≠ïÔ∏è Use [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) for learning concepts, tools, and practicing at the same time. When you are confident, use [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). Then head over to [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

‚≠ïÔ∏è If you want a job in cybersecurity, most companies will require you to have some specific certifications. Some good certifications are:
- [CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP)
